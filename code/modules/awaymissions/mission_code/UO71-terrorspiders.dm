	All the spiders are deadly. We know this much already. Within an hour of their appearance, they have killed several staff.<br>\

	The Mother is held in containment 1. Advise leaving her alone.<br>\
	It is likely that the hundreds of tiny spiders swarming over her back would come to her defense if she was threatened.<br>\

	The Prince is held in containment 2. He appears very aggressive, incredibly fast, strong, and durable. Extreme force and agility would be required to neutralize him.<br>\
	It is likely the appearance of the prince was related to our initial aggression against the Queen. These things can THINK.<br>\

	The Queen cannot be contained. She lives in the old bar, south of mining. She continues to breed dangerous spiders at an alarming rate.<br>\
	Many of her offspring are already roaming the compound, traveling through the vents. Contact with the team sent to subdue her has been lost.<br>\
